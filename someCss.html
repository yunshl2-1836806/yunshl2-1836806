        <p class="a">A pixel is represented by a dot or square on a computer monitor display 
        and are created using geometric coordinates. Depending on the graphics card 
        and display monitor, the quantity, size and color combination of pixels varies and 
        is measured in terms of the display resolution</p>
        <p class="b">Last weekend I went to Capitol Hills with bunch of friends, and we have
        had a great time there. We had brunch together, and it was amazing I would say the dishes
        we ordered are really tasted. Then we just hangout for a while, got some chances to visit
        many local shops including some well-designed stores. Even though I did not buy anything but
        it is still a pretty fun experience. </p>
